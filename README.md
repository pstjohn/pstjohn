### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on graph convolutional neural networks for organic and inorganic material design, as well as reinforcement learning methods for generating new candidates. Follow my progress here:
* [NREL/rlmolecule](https://github.com/nrel/rlmolecule)
* [NREL/graph-env](github.com/nreL/graph-env/)
* [NREL/alfabet](https://github.com/nrel/alfabet)

I'm also interested in developing interactive ML tools in the computational chemistry space. See them here:
